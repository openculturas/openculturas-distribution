# Working with the render pipeline

## When to use this guidance

You are writing or modifying code that produces HTML output in Drupal — page
controllers, block plugins, field formatters, preprocess functions, or anything
that returns a render array. Drupal's render pipeline is where AI agents
confabulate most frequently, and the errors are especially dangerous because
they produce working code in development that breaks under caching in
production.

## Guidance

### Return render arrays, not HTML strings

Page controllers that serve HTML must return render arrays, not raw HTML or
`Response` objects. Render arrays are structured data that the render system
turns into HTML while preserving cacheability metadata.

```php
// Correct: render array with cache metadata.
public function myPage(): array {
  return [
    '#theme' => 'my_template',
    '#title' => $this->t('Page title'),
    '#items' => $this->loadItems(),
    '#cache' => [
      'tags' => ['node_list'],
      'contexts' => ['user.permissions'],
    ],
  ];
}
```

When you return a `Response` object or a raw HTML string from a controller,
Drupal cannot attach cache metadata to the output. The page either becomes
uncacheable or caches incorrectly. Return a `Response` only when you are
intentionally bypassing the render system (JSON endpoints, file downloads) and
are handling caching yourself. For JSON endpoints, use `CacheableJsonResponse`
to attach cache metadata to non-HTML responses.

### Cacheability metadata is mandatory

Every render array that varies by user, permission, route, or query string must
declare its **cache contexts**. Every render array that depends on an entity or
config object must declare its **cache tags**. Missing metadata means the render
system cannot cache the output correctly.

```php
$build['#cache']['contexts'][] = 'user.permissions';
$build['#cache']['tags'][] = 'node:42';
$build['#cache']['max-age'] = 3600;
```

The three types:

- **Cache contexts**: dimensions of variation (user role, URL, language). If the
  output differs by user permission, add `user.permissions`.
- **Cache tags**: data dependencies. If the output includes node 42, add
  `node:42`. When that node changes, the cache entry is invalidated.
- **Max-age**: time-based expiration in seconds. Use `0` for uncacheable, `-1`
  (Cache::PERMANENT) for no time limit. Max-age uses **minimum-wins bubbling**:
  when a child render array has `max-age: 0`, it propagates up and forces the
  entire parent to be uncacheable. This is why lazy builders exist — without
  them, a single personalized element with `max-age: 0` would make the whole
  page uncacheable.

A fourth property, **cache keys** (`#cache['keys']`), controls whether a render
array is individually stored in the render cache. Without keys, a render
array's metadata bubbles up to parents, but the array itself is not cached
independently.

For non-trivial cache metadata operations — especially merging metadata across
render arrays and non-render-array objects — use the `CacheableMetadata` value
object rather than manipulating raw array keys:

```php
$cache_metadata = CacheableMetadata::createFromRenderArray($build);
$cache_metadata->addCacheTags(['node:42']);
$cache_metadata->addCacheContexts(['user.permissions']);
$cache_metadata->applyTo($build);
```

`CacheableMetadata` handles correct merging of tags, contexts, and max-age
(including minimum-wins). The raw array approach works for simple cases, but
when merging metadata between render arrays and `AccessResult` objects, config
overrides, or REST responses, `CacheableMetadata` prevents the subtle merge
bugs that raw array manipulation introduces.

### Metadata bubbles up — but requires explicit attachment in some cases

Cacheability metadata propagates automatically up the render tree. When a child
render array declares `node:42` as a cache tag, the parent page-level render
inherits it. But this only works when the entire output chain uses render
arrays. If you bypass the render system at any level — raw HTML, string
concatenation, a Response object — metadata from that subtree is silently lost.

Several subsystems require **explicit** cache metadata attachment — automatic
bubbling does not cover them:

- **Access results**: `AccessResult` objects carry their own cacheability. When
  an access check varies by user permission, the `AccessResult` must declare
  `user.permissions` as a cache context, or the access decision may be cached
  without the variation.
- **Config overrides**: config override classes must declare the cache contexts
  and tags that their overrides depend on.
- **Entity translations**: runtime cache contexts for language negotiation must
  be added via the entity's `getCacheContexts()`.

The `#access` render property controls whether an element is processed at all.
It accepts both booleans and `AccessResult` objects. When using an
`AccessResult`, its cacheability metadata is merged into the render tree. When
using a plain boolean, no cacheability information is conveyed — which can
cause silent caching bugs where access decisions are cached without the
correct variation.

### Lazy builders for personalized content

The Dynamic Page Cache caches full page render arrays for anonymous and
authenticated users, replacing personalized sections with placeholders. Lazy
builders are how you mark a section as "fill this in per-request":

```php
$build['user_greeting'] = [
  '#lazy_builder' => [
    'my_module.greeting_builder:build',
    [$account_id],
  ],
  '#create_placeholder' => TRUE,
];
```

**Lazy builder arguments must be scalar values only** (strings, integers,
floats, booleans, or NULL). The arguments are serialized into the placeholder
markup, so arrays, objects, and render arrays cannot be passed. This is a
common mistake in AI-generated code — pass an entity ID, not an entity object.

Without lazy builders, any personalized content (username, cart count,
user-specific messages) forces the entire page to be uncacheable. If you are
adding user-specific output to a page, always use a lazy builder.

**BigPipe** is the production consumer of the placeholder system. It streams
the page HTML immediately and replaces lazy builder placeholders via chunked
transfer as they resolve. Code that renders placeholder content into strings
before BigPipe can intercept it defeats this mechanism.

### Cache tag invalidation is two-phase

When a cache tag is invalidated (e.g., a node is saved), Drupal updates the
tag's checksum immediately but does not eagerly delete cached items from the
backend. On the next read, the stored checksum no longer matches the current
one, so the cache returns a miss and the item is regenerated. The stale entry
may remain in the backend until overwritten or naturally expired — the
important point is that the read sees a miss, not that the data is physically
gone. This is a deliberate performance design — mass invalidation is cheap
because it writes one checksum row, not N cache deletes.

Do not write code that expects cached items to be physically absent immediately
after invalidation. The cache will return a miss, but the old data may still
exist in the backend.

### Render element types

Drupal has several render element types that agents confuse:

- **`#theme`**: delegates to a theme template. The standard choice for
  structured output with a Twig template.
- **`#type`**: uses a render element plugin (form elements, tables, links).
- **`#markup`**: filtered HTML. Runs through `Xss::filterAdmin()`, which
  allows a limited set of tags. However, values that already implement
  `MarkupInterface` (from `t()`, `Markup::create()`, etc.) bypass this filter
  entirely. Do not wrap user input in `Markup::create()` to suppress escaping
  warnings — this silently defeats the XSS filter.
- **`#plain_text`**: escaped text. Use this for user-generated content that
  should not contain any HTML.
- **`inline_template`** (`#type => 'inline_template'`): renders a Twig snippet
  inline without a separate template file. Use for small dynamic HTML fragments
  that do not warrant a full theme template.

Use `#theme` for structured templates, `#plain_text` for user content,
`inline_template` for small Twig snippets, and `#markup` only for trusted
admin HTML. Never use `#markup` for user input.

### Rendering outside the request pipeline

When rendering in contexts outside the normal HTTP request (queue workers,
Drush commands, cron), cacheability bubbling behaves differently. Use
`renderInIsolation()` or `renderPlain()` instead of `render()` to avoid
attaching metadata to a non-existent request context.

## What not to do

Do not return `new Response($html)` from an HTML page controller. You lose all
cacheability metadata and force the page to be uncacheable.

Do not omit cache metadata from render arrays. Missing tags cause stale
content in production; missing contexts cause personalization leaks.

Do not put personalized content (usernames, session data, cart counts) directly
in a render array. Use a lazy builder with `#create_placeholder`.

Do not pass arrays or objects as lazy builder arguments. Arguments must be
scalar values only (string, int, float, bool, NULL).

Do not use `#markup` for user-generated content. It runs through a permissive
filter that allows HTML tags. Use `#plain_text` instead.

Do not wrap user input in `Markup::create()` to suppress escaping. This
bypasses `Xss::filterAdmin()` entirely and creates an XSS vulnerability.

Do not assume cached items disappear immediately after tag invalidation.
Invalidation is two-phase — eviction happens on the next read.

Do not attach cache tags to a render array that sits outside the render tree.
Tags only bubble when they are part of the hierarchy that Drupal actually
renders.
